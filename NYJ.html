    <h1>A summary on Born A Crime by Trevor Noah</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>Summary on Chapter 1 and 2</h3>
    <section>
        <p>One of the boldly highlighted issues discussed in this book was the discrimination and segregation of South Africans
            <br>during the apartheid era. Being the capital city, it is assumed that all tribes in Nairobi coexist peacefully  and without <br>facing prejudice or segregation. 
            It is however not the case. Among the forty-plus tribes that make up Nairobi, <br>some tribes aren't even considered to be important, while some are seen as being of a higher caliber than others. <br>
            <br>
            In South Africa, their struggle for dominance and power, which promoted bloodshed was the primary cause of the <br>tribal chaos. This is also evident in Nairobi, particularly during election seasons when the Luo and Kikuyus frequently <br>cause unrest and violence as they compete for political positions led by their respective tribal leaders. <br>
            <br>
            It is abundantly evident that South Africa saw a high death toll during the apartheid era.  
            In 2007, national politics <br>in Kenya resulted in violence with more than one hundred and twenty people dying within the first two days as <br>the different tribes fought for political supremacy. <br>
            <br>
            The issue of unruly and disorderly bus conductors and drivers was another topic that was aggressively brought to light. <br>We witness Trevor's mother being threatened with death by a bus driver just because she was traveling alone and belonged <br>to a specific tribe. Bus drivers and conductors in Nairobi County are well-known for being boisterous and lacking in manners. <br>These regrettable characteristics have afflicted many Nairobi inhabitants, with women and girls being the most impacted.
